            <h1>The broken system.</h1>
            <p>Have you ever wondered who really controls the internet? Why most of what we read comes from a handful of companies or is locked behind expensive paywalls? Why stories passed down in families or learned from lived experience rarely "count" as real knowledge?</p>
            <p>What if there was another way - where information wasn't owned, ranked, or sold, but shared?</p>
            <h1>A radical alternative.</h1>
            <p>The Archive of the After is a global network of memory, stored across libraries, schools, local servers, and even personal devices. You visit it in person or online, not to scroll endlessly, but to experience knowledge: seeing, hearing, and feeling it in context. Anyone can add to it, as long as they share where it came from and how it should be used. No algorithms. No trending tabs. Just what matters, what's endangered, and what's worth remembering.</p>
            <p>It's not perfect, and will never be. </p>
            <h1>How it happens.</h1>
            <p>The Archive's roots stretch back to the 2020s, when pirate libraries, USB chains, and community servers quietly resisted the grip of paywalls, algorithms, and political filtering. Students in Southeast Asia where survival often depended on pirated files, oral histories, and community knowledge ignored by official channels. They questioned why "valid" knowledge had to come from expensive, peer-reviewed journals while lived experience was dismissed.</p>
            <p>By the early 2030s, these quiet resistances spread across the region until a viral student post in 2033 <em>"Why trust Google Scholar but not Wikipedia?"</em> turned frustration into a movement. Institutions fought back, but in 2036 a massive server crash erased decades of academic research, making the Archive indispensable. By the 2040s, copyright had been replaced by consent, guided by rotating councils of librarians, elders, and students.</p>
            <h1>The unfinished question.</h1>
            <p>The Archive was born not just from technology, but from the refusal to let knowledge be owned. Today, the Archive is part of everyday life. Yet it remains unfinished, unowned, and quietly provocative - always leaving us with the question: <em>What's worth remembering?</em></p>
