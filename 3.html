                I want to write back<br>
                To the one who shaped the system I despise.<br>
                Yet like the moon, pulling tides in secret,<br>
                I feel myself drifting toward their idea.<br>

            <p><strong>Dear CN,</strong></p>
            
            <p>I think I’m the first person to find your letter, tucked away in this corner of the building after almost twenty years. Honestly, I was really surprised first read it. I know you probably never expected an answer, but still, I’d like to reply to the questions you asked, dear girl from the past.</p>
            
            <p>Lately, I’ve been a huge fan of a group called BLAST, especially one member, Mimi. She can’t give me a physical hug since she’s an art-artist, but somehow her advice always feels like one.</p>
            
            <p>As for universities… most of them have shut down. They’ve been turned into museums or government buildings. Now, each country has only one or two left. The one we both went to still exists.</p>
            
            <p>When I learned that you were the one who started The Archive, I was stunned. In our time, The Archive isn’t just a community but a global system led by top scholars under the Council of Librarians. Because of the foundation you built, we can now access records from every civilization in history. We can also publish our own discoveries. Everything is fair. There’s no need to pay to access knowledge. All viewpoints are protected. There’s no “right” or “wrong,” no “acceptable” or “unacceptable” - only knowledge and belief.</p>
            
            <p>Traditional education has almost disappeared. People don’t see the point in going to school when they can just step into a booth, visit a civilisation’s town hall, access The Archive with their AR tools, and learn from it. But they forget that school isn’t only about gaining knowledge but also where we learn to connect, to live with others.</p>
            
            <p>About the wars: eventually, countries were forced to sign a peace treaty, whether they wanted to or not. They’re now under the control of the Council of Librarians.</p>
            
            <p>The economy? More or less the same. We’re not exactly happier, but we’re not worse off either. There are still poor people everywhere, and the elite still hold most of the world’s wealth. But there’s no such thing as “homelessness” anymore. Jobs are unlimited now, both in the virtual and physical worlds. Still, people envy each other over the tiniest things: their jobs, their relationships, even their children.</p>
            
            <p>You created The Archive with good intentions, but some have used it to divide people even more. The so-called scholars now look down on others. In this world, people expect us, the young ines, to know everything. And if we don’t, we will be labelled and left behind.</p>
            
            <p>Families no longer feel like families. Society expects too much from us and forces us to grow up too fast. School and even play have become luxuries. Maybe the emotional core of life is slowly fading.</p>
            
            <p>I used to hate The Archive so much that I refused to use it growing up. But after trying it for the first time (and finding your letter within it), I understand why we need this technology. Maybe our lives would have been worse without it.</p>
            
            <p>And no matter how much I think about it, I can’t get this thought out of mind: isn’t it strange that it wasn’t money or health, but knowledge and culture, that drove the greatest change? Do you think it’s because seeking knowledge and returning to our inner world is part of human nature? But then… why, even with it, do we still have people with bad intentions?</p>
            
            <p>Looking forwards for your response, and thank you - truly - for your passion. </p>
            
            <p><strong>Best regards,</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Lan</strong></p>
